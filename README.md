# FGI for Actionable Crypto Insights

Towards the end of my Mechatronics degree, I wanted to apply the skills I had developed—particularly in MATLAB and statistical analysis—to areas that interest me, such as Machine Learning and Cryptocurrency.

My dissertation aims to explore Incremental FGI ranges and apply statistical analysis using Machine Learning methods in MATLAB. Specifically, it seeks to understand the trends in sentiment analysis between the Fear and Greed Index (FGI) and two cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE)—to determine if there are any actionable insights driven by herd mentality.
